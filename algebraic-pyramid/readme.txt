For the purpose of this challenge we will use algebraic pyramids pointing downwards (or upside down pyramids!).

The idea of this mathematical puzzle is to fill in all the bricks of a pyramid based on the following rule:

To work out the value of a brick, add the values of the two adjacent bricks above it
Python Challenge #1: Fix sized pyramids

This Python challenge will consist of writing a procedure that will take a list of values as a parameter, and will as a result generate and output an upside down pyramid where the top layer of the pyramid will contain all the values from the given list.
To simplify this problem, we will first assume that the list of number will always contains exactly 4 values.
For example: 30 12 10 5
              42 22 15
                64 37
                  101

Add random generator based on length of base list.
