The aim of this challenge is to convert the distance between planet Earth and Alpha-Centauri from light-years to km.

To do so we will use a sequencing algorithm based on the following steps:

Calculate the number of seconds in a year,
Multiply this number by the speed of light,
Multiply this number by 4.2 (the distance of Alpha-Centauri from Earth in light-years).
Output the result/ distance in km
Step 2: using Selection

Your next challenge is to let the user choose a star, and based on their choice, you will output the distance between the selected star and planet Earth, in km using the following data:
Star	Distance from Earth (in light-years)
Alpha Centauri	4.24 light-years
Barnardâ€™s Star	5.96 light-years
Luhman 16	6.59 light-years
WISE 0855-0714	7.2 light-years
Wolf 359	7.78 light-years
To do so you will use an if, elif and else statements to implement a selection construct.
